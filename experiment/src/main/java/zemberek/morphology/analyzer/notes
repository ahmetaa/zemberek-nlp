is "balkabakçık" correct?

"balkabaklılar" -> current mechanism will fail. After derivation, some root attributes should be
removed. Check this after implementing Noun-->lI--->Adj work.

imlicitPlural and implicitDative etc. attributes should be added to master dictionary items.


Consider adding Conditions.containsAny() and Conditions.containsNone() for a group of conditions.

Instead of using "su" in Morphotactics, A "RootGroup" identifier can be used. Same exceptions
may apply to "akarsu" as well. Or, groups can be Sets of Dictionary objects. So that Conditions.containsAny
etc can be used.

Consider making "-cağız" a separate morpheme. Not Dim.

Should we remove words that exist in TDK with `-li` suffix? "zehirli, sulu" etc. They create ambiguity.

We may not need `head` in SearchPath

----

annemler, annenler etc can be resoved with implicitPlural, ImplicitP1sg and ImplicitP2sg attributes.
However, for making morphotactics work easier, A third property (FamilyMember?) can be added.

Currently we do not add root "Noun" state to the SearchPath. We should.
