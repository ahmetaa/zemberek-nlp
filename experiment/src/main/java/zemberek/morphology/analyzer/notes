is "balkabakçık" correct?

"balkabaklılar" -> current mechanism will fail. After derivation, some root attributes should be
removed. Check this after implementing Noun-->lI--->Adj work.

imlicitPlural and implicitDative etc. attributes should be added to master dictionary items.


Consider adding Conditions.containsAny() and Conditions.containsNone() for a group of conditions.

Instead of using "su" in Morphotactics, A "RootGroup" identifier can be used. Same exceptions
may apply to "akarsu" as well. Or, groups can be Sets of Dictionary objects. So that Conditions.containsAny
etc can be used.

Consider making "-cağız" a separate morpheme. Not Dim.

Should we remove words that exist in TDK with `-li` suffix? "zehirli, sulu" etc. They create ambiguity.

We may not need `head` in SearchPath

Noun->Zero Verb derivation correct and false positive tests -> elmalarımdı elmamdım elmandım elmamdır.
how about implicitplural derivation etc?

"JustLike" does not sound right. "odun-su". Resemblance?

"elmamımdır", "elmalarlar" seems incorrect but Oflazer accepts.

"odun-lar-dır" vs "odun-dur-lar" Oflazer gives same analysis for both.
(elma+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom^DB+Verb+Zero+Pres+A3pl+Cop)  Should we allow "odun-dur-lar"?

"elmalar" now also has a Verb result. Such as
elma:Noun + A3sg + Pnon + Nom + Zero + Verb + Pres + lar:A3pl
Example: "Bunlar o elmalar.". However this actually generates a lot of ambiguity. Should we disallow?

should we accept bot "yeşilimsi" and "yeşilsi" (currently we do)

oflazer does not have `onlar` as a pronoun. it uses `o` and A3pl

Oflzer accepts bunla =   [(bu:bu) (Pron,Demons;A3sg+Pnon+Inst:nla)]
               bununla = [(bu:bu) (Pron,Demons;A3sg+Pnon+Inst:nunla)]
should there be a `bunla`?

Oflazer parses `bunlu`and `bunsuz` as separate adjectives.

herkes is implicitly plural. Perhaps we should also accept `herkesler` as same.

Should RootAttrubute and Root contitions also check if there is no derivation?

Oflazer does not offer A3pl+Pnon analysis for herkesler and öbürküler. We allow it.
is "öbürkülerim" ok?

Oflazer has pron+Quant and Noun forms for "kimse". kimseler only accepted for Noun or Pron->Verb+A3pl.
Here I decided to connect "kimse" pronoun to Name-A3sg and Name-A3pl states. This way all name
suffixes will apply but it will be a pronoun.

should we parse `nemiz, neniz (neyimiz, neyiniz)`

`kimlerimde` etc. sounds bad. Should we restrict?

Adjective "öbür" should not get any suffixes.

Added "falan, falanca" as personal pronoun. Oflazer does not.
Added "berili" as qunatitive pronoun. Oflazer does not.

Sak, uses "-leri" surface as A3pl+P3pl in "kendileri". Perhaps we should use that. Now we have "ler-i" A3pl+P3pl
I make changes for Reflexive and some Quantitive pronouns but not all are covered.

We do not allow zero->Verb+..+lar for pronouns. Oflazer does.

Oflazer does not anayze elmaymışımdır. we do.

Oflazer does not analyze elmaymışsa. we do

akarsu also behaves like su but maybe both `akarsum` and `akarsuyum` are accepted.

Oflazer uses Prog1 (Progressive 1) for -iyor and Prog2 fo `-makta` should they be combined?
Combining may create ambiguity for generation. Perhaps generation should offer multiple solutions anyway.

Oflzer uses `Pos` for Positive in verbs. I decided not to use it for now to reduce clutter.
Perhaps we should get rid of Pnon as well.

Some verbs can have "-ir" suffix to make it Causative. Piş-ir, kaç-ır, şiş-ir, uç-ur.
There are two ways of handling those.
a) Add it as a separate verb without tagging implicit Causative.
b) like Oflazer, make it causative. [pişirdi piş+Verb^DB+Verb+Caus+Pos+Past+A3sg]

Both "okuyun" and "okuyunuz" have Imp+P2pl analysis. Bu semantically they are a little different
Second one is "kind". Should we introduce another morpheme for it?

okuyamayabilir oflazer offers two Able derivation here. Able->Neg->Able. Perhaps second Able can be
considered as "probability" but surely this will create ambiguity for regular "Able", like "okuyabilir"

----

annemler, annenler etc can be resoved with implicitPlural, ImplicitP1sg and ImplicitP2sg attributes.
However, for making morphotactics work easier, A third property (FamilyMember?) can be added.

Currently we do not add root "Noun" state to the SearchPath. We should.
